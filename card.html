			<p>Loyal, loveable, happy and friendly to all he meets, the Labrador Retriever is the number one registered dog in the AKC. Labs are full of energy and will run to the door to greet you (or anyone, for that matter) as if you'd just returned from a year-long trip. They are truly “man's best friend,” and are at their happiest when engaged in family activities. They love running, hiking, swimming and playing fetch for hours on end and are extremely patient with children of all ages. Labs are a breeze to train, and as long as you are prepared to live with puppy-like behavior well into adulthood, they make an excellent choice for first time dog owners.</p>
